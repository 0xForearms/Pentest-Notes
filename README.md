# Just a place for various notes/scripts I've wanted to save.

[Downloaders.md](./Downloaders.md) is a collection of command line download strings.  Both Windows and Linux, nothing new, just took stuff that I've seen and used from various sources and put it in one location.  

[LinuxPE.md](./LinuxPE.md) is a collection of common Linux Priv Esc techniques.  Similiar as above, shouldn't really be anything new, just wanted them in one place.  

[Shells & Paylods.md](./Shells_&_Paylods.md) is a collection of one line reverse shells.  

[win-shell.php](./win-shell.php) is a windows reverse php shell.  I didn't have one that I liked until I stumbled upon this one, can't remember where it's from, but I've used it a few times and have had good luck with it.
